###What kinds of projects do you work on?

###How do you approach a new project? Walk me through the process.

I start off with a round of stakeholder interviews to understand the
problem and the scope of the desired solution. During these interviews I
don't focus on a particular proposed solution. Anything is possible at
this point in the project.

Once I have a grasp of the problem and scope, I have a second round of
interviews to develop a user experience that matches how each type of
user user thinks about their work. In these interviews, we walk through
a quick mock up of the proposed solution. Typically this mock up is a
slide show where each screen that the user would see when working
through a use case. The UI mock ups are helpful for sparking
conversation, and getting users to really think about exactly how they'd
like to interact with the solution.

by interviewing stakeholders to understand the problem. In
this first round of interviews, I focus only on the problem and I
discourage in-depth discussion of potential solutions. Phrasing things
in terms of problems rather than solutions prevents me from "falling in
love" with a solution.

I start off with a lot of interactive interviews. After initial
requirements elicitation, I like to move to a fast UI mock up that
illustrates the flow of the application for various use cases. This
first mock up is just a PowerPoint presentation where each slide shows
the next screen that the user would see. I don't get fancy with this,
since it's critical to iterate quickly in this phase. We have a lot of
ground to cover, and we expect a lot of changes, so there's no return on
investment for putting time into making the slide mock ups look sexy.

First and foremost: stakeholder engagement is key. Heavy stakeholder
engagement is key for crafting a solution that is relevant to the user
and effective in the field.
